- 👋 Hi, I’m Surajudeen Monsurat,
- 📫 I recently completed my data analytics training, and so far, I’ve challenged myself to further explore datasets that have stretched me to improve my problem-solving, and data analysis skills. 
- 🌱 I have explored various datasets that demonstrated my analytics skills in SQL, Excel, PowerBI and Tableau. 
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate with any individual, company or organizations looking to making strategic business decisions by utilizing insights from their business data. 
- ⚡ When I’m not on my laptop analysing data, I read books, watch movies, or try new recipes. 
- 🤗 You can connect with me [here]( www.linkedin.com/in/monsurat-surajudeen)
